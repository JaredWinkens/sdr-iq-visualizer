# SDR IQ Data Visualization Platform

> A web-based real-time visualization and analysis platform for Software-Defined Radio (SDR) IQ data

## üéØ Overview

This platform provides an accessible, browser-based interface for visualizing and analyzing raw IQ (In-phase/Quadrature) data from Software-Defined Radios, specifically designed for the ADALM-Pluto SDR. Built to bridge the gap between complex SDR tools and educational/research needs, it offers real-time signal visualization without requiring specialized software installations.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Visualizations
- **Time-domain plots** - Raw IQ sample visualization
- **Frequency spectrum analysis** - Real-time FFT processing and display
- **Constellation diagrams** - Interactive modulation characteristic visualization  
- **Waterfall plots** - Spectral activity over time with color-coded intensity

### Interactive Controls
- Real-time frequency tuning
- Adjustable bandwidth and gain settings
- Synchronized multi-view dashboard
- Device-agnostic web interface

### Extended Analysis (Planned)
- Basic demodulation modes (AM/FM)
- Machine learning-based modulation classification
- Data export for offline analysis
- Integration APIs for external tools

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform consists of three main components:

1. **Backend Signal Processing** - Communicates with SDR hardware, captures IQ samples, and performs digital signal processing
2. **Web Frontend** - Browser-based visualization interface with real-time data streaming
3. **Analysis Engine** - Advanced signal processing and optional ML-based classification

## üéì Educational Impact

Designed specifically for:
- **Students** learning communication systems and DSP concepts
- **Researchers** needing flexible signal exploration tools  
- **Educators** demonstrating abstract RF concepts interactively
- **Hobbyists** exploring the radio frequency spectrum
